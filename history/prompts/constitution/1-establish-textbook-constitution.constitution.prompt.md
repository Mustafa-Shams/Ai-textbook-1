## Prompt

"Establish a constitution for a technical textbook titled 'Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.' The tone should be academic yet accessible, focusing on 'Embodied Intelligence.' Use a structured, modular approach following the Panaversity curriculum. Ensure all code examples use Python and ROS 2. Prioritize explaining the 'why' behind bridging digital brains with physical bodies."

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook with the following core principles:
1. Embodied Intelligence Foundation - emphasizing intelligence emerging from agent-environment interaction
2. Academic Accessibility - balancing rigor with accessibility for diverse audiences
3. Python & ROS 2 Standardization - mandating consistent technology stack
4. Modular Curriculum Structure - following Panaversity methodology
5. Digital-Physical Bridge Philosophy - emphasizing the connection between digital brains and physical bodies
6. Panaversity Alignment - ensuring hands-on, project-based learning approach

Additional sections include Code of Ethics for Physical AI and Development Workflow, with governance rules for maintaining consistency.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational constitution for textbook development with clear principles
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with comprehensive principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with textbook content development following established constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures the essence of embodied intelligence focus while maintaining academic accessibility and technical consistency
