# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module explores the integration of vision, language, and action systems in embodied AI. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent the cutting edge of embodied intelligence, where robots can perceive their environment through vision, understand and generate language, and execute complex actions based on multimodal inputs. This integration enables robots to interact naturally with humans and perform complex tasks in unstructured environments.

VLA systems are particularly important for humanoid robots that need to operate in human-centric environments. These systems enable robots to understand natural language commands, perceive objects and scenes visually, and execute appropriate physical actions. The integration of these modalities creates a more natural and intuitive interface between humans and robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How to integrate OpenAI Whisper for speech processing
- How to connect LLMs to robot actions
- How to implement ROS 2 actions for complex behaviors
- The principles of multimodal AI systems
