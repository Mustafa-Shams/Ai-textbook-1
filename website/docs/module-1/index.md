# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the communication backbone that enables coordination between different components of a robotic system.

## Core Concepts

ROS 2 provides the infrastructure for:
- **Nodes**: Individual processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Streams of messages passed between nodes
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How to design and implement ROS 2 nodes
- The principles of message passing and communication patterns
- How to structure robot software using ROS 2 architecture
- How to represent robot structure using URDF

## Navigation

- [Core Concepts: Nodes, Topics, Services](./concepts.md)
- [rclpy Implementation Examples](./rclpy-examples.md)
- [URDF Structures for Humanoid Joints/Links](./urdf-structures.md)

## Next Steps

After mastering the basics of ROS 2 communication, continue to the next module to learn about digital twins and simulation environments.
