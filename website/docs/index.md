# Introduction: The Shift from Digital Brain to Physical Body

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide explores the fascinating field of embodied intelligence, where artificial intelligence meets physical robotics.

## What is Embodied Intelligence?

Embodied intelligence is the concept that true artificial intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment. Rather than processing information in isolation, embodied AI systems learn and adapt through sensorimotor interaction with the world.

## The Digital-Physical Bridge

Traditional AI systems operate in digital spaces, processing data without physical embodiment. However, real-world intelligence requires:
- Sensory perception of the environment
- Physical interaction with objects
- Adaptive behavior based on environmental feedback
- Integration of multiple sensory modalities

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into progressive modules:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding the communication backbone
2. **The Digital Twin** - Simulation and modeling environments
3. **The AI-Robot Brain** - Intelligence and decision-making systems
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Multimodal integration
5. **Capstone Project** - Complete autonomous humanoid implementation

## Getting Started

Begin your journey into embodied intelligence by exploring the modules in sequence, or jump to specific topics using the navigation sidebar. Each module builds upon the previous, creating a comprehensive understanding of physical AI systems.
