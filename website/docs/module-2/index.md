# Module 2: The Digital Twin

This module explores the concept of digital twins in robotics - virtual representations of physical robots that enable simulation, testing, and validation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How to create simulation environments using Gazebo
- How to implement rendering with Unity
- How to simulate sensors like LiDAR and depth cameras
- The role of digital twins in robot development

## Navigation

- [Tools: Gazebo & Unity](./tools.md)
- [Sensors: LiDAR and Depth Cameras](./sensors.md)

## Next Steps

After understanding digital twins, proceed to Module 3 to learn about AI integration.
